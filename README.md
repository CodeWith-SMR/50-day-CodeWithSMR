# 50-day-CodeWithSMR
Design: CodeWithSMR


Welcome to the **50-day-CodeWithSMR** project! This project is a collection of 50 unique web development mini-projects built using **HTML**, **SCSS**, and **JavaScript**. The goal is to practice and improve your front-end development skills by creating a project every day for 50 days.

## Introduction

In this project, we will explore different features of **HTML**, **SCSS** (for advanced and modular CSS), and **JavaScript** to create fully functional mini-projects. Each day brings a new challenge, helping you develop hands-on experience with various web development concepts.

Some examples of what we will build include:

- Responsive web pages
- Dynamic UI elements (sliders, modals, etc.)
- Form validation
- Animations and transitions
- Interactive user interfaces with JavaScript

Each project will emphasize best practices in web design, SCSS structuring, and JavaScript functionality.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For the structure and content of web pages.
- **SCSS**: For styling, using features like variables, mixins, and nesting.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: For adding dynamic behavior and interactive functionality to the web pages.

## Project Structure

Each day’s project will be stored in its own folder with the following structure:



/50-day-CodeWithSMR/ ├── Day1/ │ ├── index.html │ ├── styles.scss │ └── script.js ├── Day2/ │ ├── index.html │ ├── styles.scss │ └── script.js ├── ... └── Day50/ ├── index.html ├── styles.scss └── script.js
